## FIFA Dataset Analysis

This project uses a FIFA dataset sourced from Kaggle to perform data analysis on player statistics. By utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib, we explore key trends, player performance metrics, and other insights. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook, which allows for interactive data exploration and visualization, revealing patterns in player attributes, team performance, and more.
